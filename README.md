# RoomBook API
This is an API that allows booking a meeting room, viewing all meeting room's bookings and cancel a booking. 

### Get the application up & running 
To run the application there must be a running Docker instance like Docker Desktop.  
Once Docker Desktop is up, open a terminal in the application's root folder and run: 
1) `./gradlew clean build` 
2) `docker-compose up --build`
